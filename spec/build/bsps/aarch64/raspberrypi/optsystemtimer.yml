description: |
  The clock from the ARM timer is derived from the system clock. This clock can change dynamically e.g. if the system
  goes into reduced power or in low power mode. Thus the clock speed adapts to the overall system performance
  capabilities. For accurate timing it is recommended to use the system timers.
